My name is John Easter. I am a former paratrooper of the U.S Army
82nd Airborne Division, 1st/504th Parachute Infantry Regiment.
I am now 47 years old, 26 years removed from the Army, and I have severe
arthritis in the medial compartment of my right knee joint. I am unable to walk and move
around unless I use a crutch or cane. I feel so debilitated, but I know from observation that 
others are worse off than me. My back hurts, ksdljslkkfksskdjjpkjwr; Matt Woodall, Dana Bowman
lsdkowerjislkd Wayne Kannapple, Terry Bennett, Tommy Vansciver. Looking for my army buddy/friend 
Steven Gillespie. What happened to Steven Gillespie. I remember Drill Sargeant Guthrie. He was cool, and we 
all thought Steven Gillespie looked like him. We called him Little Guthrie.
